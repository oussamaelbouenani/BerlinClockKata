# BerlinClockKata
TDD project as part of the 2nd year DevOps course

## Introduction
Loubna and I worked together on this project.
We finally had the opportunity to put test-driven development into practice. It is a first for us to work starting with the tests.
With this method, we very rarely encountered bugs which allowed us to focus first on the expected result rather than on how to do it.

## prerequisite
- PHP ^7.3
- Composer 2.0.8

## Build and Test
- composer install : to install dependencies.
- ./vendor/bin/phpunit *Test.php : to run tests.
